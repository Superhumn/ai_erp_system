# Deployment Setup Guide

This guide walks through configuring the CI/CD pipeline for the AI ERP System.

## Workflows Overview

| Workflow | File | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| **CI** | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | PRs to `main`, pushes to `main` | Type-check, test, and build |
| **Deploy** | `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | Push to `main`, manual dispatch | Deploy to staging then production |
| **Delete Branches** | `.github/workflows/delete-merged-branches.yml` | PR closed (merged) | Clean up merged branches |

## CI Pipeline

Runs automatically on every PR and push to `main`:

```
typecheck ──┐
            ├──→ build
test ───────┘
```

- **Type Check** and **Test** run in parallel
- **Build** only runs if both pass
- Duplicate runs are cancelled via concurrency groups

## Deploy Pipeline

Triggered on push to `main` or manual dispatch:

```
CI ──→ Deploy Staging ──→ Deploy Production
```

- Calls the CI workflow first (reusable workflow)
- **Staging** deploys automatically after CI passes
- **Production** requires manual approval (configured in GitHub Environment settings)

## GitHub Environment Setup

You must configure two environments in the GitHub repository settings.

### 1. Create Environments

Go to **Settings → Environments** in your GitHub repository and create:

#### `staging`
- No protection rules needed (auto-deploys after CI)
- Add the following secrets and variables:
  - **Secret:** `RAILWAY_TOKEN` — Railway deploy token for the staging project
  - **Variable:** `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID` — Railway service ID for the staging service

#### `production`
- **Required reviewers:** Add at least one team member who must approve production deploys
- **Branch restrictions:** Limit to `main` branch only
- **Wait timer:** (Optional) Add a 5-minute wait to allow for last-minute cancellation
- Add the following secrets and variables:
  - **Secret:** `RAILWAY_TOKEN` — Railway deploy token for the production project
  - **Variable:** `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID` — Railway service ID for the production service

### 2. Get Railway Tokens

For each Railway project/environment:

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings → Tokens**
3. Create a new **Deploy Token** (scoped to that project)
4. Copy the token and add it as the `RAILWAY_TOKEN` secret in the corresponding GitHub environment

### 3. Get Railway Service IDs

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on the service
3. The service ID is in the URL: `railway.app/project/.../service/<SERVICE_ID>`
4. Add it as the `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID` variable in the corresponding GitHub environment

## Manual Deployment

To trigger a deployment manually (e.g., for a hotfix):

1. Go to **Actions → Deploy** in your GitHub repository
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select the branch to deploy from
4. The workflow will run CI, deploy to staging, then await production approval

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm install          # Install dependencies
pnpm run dev          # Start dev server
pnpm run check        # Type check
pnpm run test         # Run tests
pnpm run build        # Build for production
pnpm run format       # Format code with Prettier
```
